Bosque Los Arrayanes Website - UX & Design Audit
Critical Issues üî¥

1. Severely Outdated Visual Design

Problem: The website looks like it's from the early 2000s
Impact: Immediately damages credibility and trust. Visitors will question if the business is still operating or professional
Priority: CRITICAL

2. No Mobile Responsiveness

Problem: The site is not optimized for mobile devices
Impact: In 2025, 60-70% of users browse on mobile. You're losing the majority of potential customers immediately
Priority: CRITICAL

3. Tiny, Poor Quality Images

Problem: Images are extremely small thumbnails with low resolution
Impact: For a nature tourism experience, images should be the hero. You can't sell a beautiful forest tour with tiny, pixelated photos
Priority: CRITICAL

4. No Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)

Problem: No obvious "Book Now" or "Reserve" button above the fold
Impact: Visitors don't know what action to take. High bounce rate guaranteed
Priority: CRITICAL

5. Flash-Based Elements

Problem: The site appears to use Flash or very outdated technology
Impact: Flash is dead (discontinued 2020). Many browsers won't display this content at all
Priority: CRITICAL

Major Issues üü† 6. No Hero Section

Problem: The page starts with menu and small images, no impactful first impression
Impact: You lose the chance to capture attention and emotion immediately
Fix Needed: Full-screen hero image of the Arrayanes forest with compelling headline

7. Cluttered Layout

Problem: Too many elements competing for attention, no clear visual hierarchy
Impact: Cognitive overload - visitors don't know where to look first
Fix Needed: Implement clear sections with generous whitespace

8. Weak Typography

Problem: Small, default system fonts with poor readability
Impact: Hard to read = visitors leave quickly
Fix Needed: Modern font stack with proper sizing and hierarchy

9. No Social Proof

Problem: No reviews, testimonials, or trust indicators
Impact: Visitors have no reason to trust you over competitors
Fix Needed: Add TripAdvisor reviews, star ratings, testimonials with photos

10. Poor Navigation Structure

Problem: Menu items aren't clearly organized or labeled
Impact: Users can't find information easily
Fix Needed: Simplified, clear navigation (About, Tours, Prices, Gallery, Contact)

Content Issues üìù 11. Weak Value Proposition

Problem: The headline doesn't capture what makes this experience unique
Current: "Bosque Los Arrayanes a bordo del Catamar√°n Futaleufu"
Impact: Descriptive, not inspiring
Suggested Fix: "Discover a Forest That Exists Nowhere Else on Earth" or "Navigate Lake Nahuel Huapi to a One-of-a-Kind Array√°n Forest"

12. Wall of Text

Problem: Long paragraph dumps without breaks or visual interest
Impact: Nobody reads long paragraphs on websites
Fix Needed: Break into scannable sections with headers, bullets, and white space

13. No Emotional Storytelling

Problem: Content is purely informational and technical
Impact: Doesn't inspire booking - people buy experiences based on emotion
Fix Needed: Paint a picture of the experience (the boat ride, the forest, the wildlife)

14. Missing Key Information

Problem: Can't easily find:

Departure times
Duration of tour
What's included
Price (or price range)
Age restrictions
Weather policies
What to bring

Impact: Visitors leave to find a site with clear information

15. No Urgency or Scarcity

Problem: Nothing motivates immediate booking
Fix Needed: "Limited daily departures" or "Book ahead - tours fill quickly in peak season"

Technical Issues ‚öôÔ∏è 16. Slow Load Time

Problem: Based on old technology, likely loads slowly
Impact: 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load
Priority: HIGH

17. No HTTPS Security

Problem: URL shows "http://" not "https://"
Impact: Modern browsers show "Not Secure" warnings, damaging trust
Priority: HIGH

18. Poor SEO Structure

Problem: No visible SEO optimization (meta tags, alt text, structured data)
Impact: Invisible to search engines = no organic traffic
Priority: HIGH

19. No Analytics Integration

Problem: Likely no tracking of visitor behavior
Impact: Can't measure or improve performance
Priority: MEDIUM

Missing Features üö´ 20. No Online Booking System

Problem: Visitors likely have to call or email
Impact: Massive friction - most won't convert
Fix Needed: Integrated booking calendar with instant confirmation

21. No Multi-Language Support

Problem: Only Spanish (you're in a tourist destination!)
Impact: Missing English-speaking tourists (huge market)
Priority: HIGH

22. No Gallery/Photo Section

Problem: You have a visually stunning product but no way to showcase it
Impact: Can't inspire bookings through imagery
Fix Needed: Dedicated gallery page with large, high-quality photos

23. No Video Content

Problem: Video would be perfect for showing the boat ride and forest
Impact: Missing the most engaging content format
Fix Needed: Hero video or embedded YouTube tour video

24. No FAQ Section

Problem: Visitors can't self-serve answers
Impact: More emails/calls for basic questions, fewer bookings
Fix Needed: Comprehensive FAQ addressing common concerns

25. No Contact Form

Problem: Forces visitors to open email client
Impact: Added friction = lost bookings
Fix Needed: Simple in-page contact form

26. No Map Integration
