**Design Inspiration Reference**

---

## Overview

This style guide captures the essence and design approach of a premium outdoor/wilderness experience landing page. Use this as creative direction to build new landing pages that evoke the same emotional response and visual impact, while allowing flexibility for specific content and branding.

---

## 1. Design Philosophy & Objectives

### Primary Objective

Create an **immersive, aspirational experience** that transports visitors into the natural environment before they even book. The page should make visitors feel the serenity, adventure, and escape that the experience offers.

### Emotional Goals

- **Inspire wanderlust** and desire to disconnect from daily life
- **Convey premium quality** without feeling pretentious
- **Build trust** through professional presentation and authentic imagery
- **Create urgency** through beautiful, limited-availability positioning

### Design Approach

- **Story over sales** - Guide visitors through a narrative journey
- **Show, don't tell** - Let large, atmospheric imagery do the heavy lifting
- **Breathing room** - Generous whitespace and unhurried pacing
- **Organic flow** - Natural transitions that mimic the outdoor environment

---

## 2. Visual Mood & Atmosphere

### Overall Mood

**"Cinematic nature documentary meets luxury retreat"**

### Descriptive Keywords

- Moody and atmospheric
- Serene yet adventurous
- Premium but authentic
- Intimate and immersive
- Contemplative and peaceful
- Sophisticated rustic

### Atmosphere Characteristics

- **Misty morning** quality - soft, diffused light
- **Golden hour warmth** - rich, inviting color tones
- **Forest depth** - layered, mysterious backgrounds
- **Human scale** - people present but not dominant
- **Seasonal authenticity** - real weather, real conditions

---

## 3. Color Philosophy

### Color Mood

**Deep, natural tones with organic warmth**

### Primary Color Character

- **Deep forest greens/teals** - Main brand presence
  - Sophisticated, not bright
  - Suggests depth and tranquility
  - Works for both backgrounds and accents
  - Think: old-growth forest canopy, deep lake water

### Supporting Color Characters

- **Warm earth tones** - Secondary accents

  - Sunset golds, campfire amber, weathered wood
  - Use sparingly for highlights and calls-to-action
  - Creates welcoming contrast against cool primaries

- **Neutral darks** - Typography and depth

  - Near-black, charcoal, deep brown
  - Grounds the design
  - Readable without being harsh

- **Soft off-whites** - Alternative backgrounds
  - Never pure white - always warmed or cooled slightly
  - Creates gentle contrast sections
  - Maintains the organic feel

### Color Application Strategy

- **Alternating rhythm**: Dark section → Light section → Dark section
- **Overlays**: Images with colored transparent overlays (30-60% opacity)
- **Gradients**: Subtle, natural gradients (not vibrant)
- **Depth through tone**: Darker = more immersive, lighter = informational

---

## 4. Typography Philosophy

### Font Personality

**Headlines: Elegant & Literary**

- Serif fonts that feel classic but not old-fashioned
- Substantial weight without being heavy
- High contrast between thick and thin strokes
- Evokes quality publications and timeless design
- Examples of this style: Playfair Display, Bodoni, Didot, Cormorant

**Body: Modern & Readable**

- Clean sans-serif for effortless reading
- Medium weight for substance
- Generous line height for breathing room
- Neutral character that doesn't compete with headlines
- Examples of this style: Inter, Source Sans Pro, Open Sans

### Typographic Hierarchy

- **Large, confident headlines** - Command attention without shouting
- **Poetic, descriptive subheadlines** - Set the mood and expectation
- **Generous spacing** - Never cramped or rushed
- **Thoughtful line length** - 60-80 characters maximum for readability

### Typography Mood

- Headlines should feel like **book titles or film credits**
- Body text should feel like **quality editorial content**
- Overall impression: **Refined but approachable**

---

## 5. Imagery Guidelines

### Photography Style

**Primary Characteristics:**

- **Atmospheric conditions**: Mist, fog, golden hour, dramatic clouds
- **Depth and layers**: Foreground, middle ground, background all visible
- **Cinematic composition**: Wide shots that establish place and mood
- **Authentic moments**: Real experiences, not overly staged
- **Human presence**: People as part of the landscape, not the focus
- **Color grading**: Cool blues and greens with warm orange/golden accents

**Shot Types to Include:**

- **Establishing shots**: Wide landscapes that show the environment
- **Detail shots**: Close-ups of textures (bark, water, fabric, fire)
- **Lifestyle moments**: People experiencing the space naturally
- **Atmospheric scenes**: Sunrise/sunset, weather, seasonal elements
- **Facilities**: Accommodations shown in context of nature

**What to Avoid:**

- Bright, midday harsh lighting
- Overly saturated colors
- Stock photo feeling
- Cluttered compositions
- Urban or modern intrusions

### Image Treatment

- **Overlays**: Dark, semi-transparent overlays on hero images (so text reads clearly)
- **Vignetting**: Subtle darkening at edges to draw focus
- **Grain**: Slight film grain acceptable for vintage/authentic feel
- **Aspect ratios**: Mostly landscape orientation (16:9, 3:2)

---

## 6. Layout Structure & Flow

### Page Architecture

**Hero Section** (First Impression)

- Full viewport height
- Immersive background image with overlay
- Centered, bold headline with poetic subheadline
- Minimal navigation (doesn't compete with hero)
- Organic transition to next section

**Content Sections** (Narrative Journey)

- Alternating full-width and contained layouts
- Mix of image-led and text-led sections
- Asymmetric compositions (not always centered)
- Each section tells part of the story

**Transition Elements** (Visual Flow)

- Organic shapes between sections (waves, torn edges, slopes)
- Color shifts that feel natural, not jarring
- Consistent downward visual pull

### Layout Principles

- **Generous spacing** - Never crowded
- **Visual hierarchy** - Clear importance ranking
- **Asymmetric balance** - Interesting but stable
- **Rhythm** - Predictable pattern with variation
- **Focus** - One primary message per section

## 7. Interactive Elements & Motion

### Animation Philosophy

**"Gentle and purposeful, never distracting"**

### Recommended Interactions

- **Slow zoom on hover** - Images gradually scale (1.05-1.1x)
- **Fade transitions** - Smooth opacity changes
- **Parallax scrolling** - Subtle depth effect (use sparingly)
- **Navigation state changes** - Smooth transparency adjustments
- **Smooth scrolling** - Gentle, eased scroll behavior

### Motion Principles

- **Slow timing** - 400-600ms transitions (never rushed)
- **Ease curves** - Natural deceleration
- **Purposeful** - Every animation serves a function
- **Subtle** - Noticeable but not flashy
- **Performance** - GPU-accelerated properties only

---

## 8. Content Tone & Messaging

### Writing Style

**"Evocative but not flowery, specific but not technical"**

### Headline Approach

- Poetic without being vague
- Makes a promise about the experience
- Uses concrete, sensory language
- Example tone: "Where Every Sunrise is a Front-Row Seat to Wonder"

### Body Copy Approach

- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Descriptive and specific
- Benefits over features
- Invites imagination

### Language Characteristics

- Second person ("you") to create intimacy
- Present tense to create immediacy
- Sensory words (sight, sound, feel)
- Place-specific details for authenticity

---

## 9. Component Patterns

### Feature Cards

- Image-dominant with minimal text overlay
- Grouped in 2-3 column grids
- Hover effects reveal more information
- Rounded corners (subtle) or sharp edges (modern)

### Call-to-Action Buttons

- Prominent but not aggressive
- Warm accent colors (earth tones, gold)
- Sufficient padding for importance
- Clear action words ("Book Your Stay", "Explore Dates")

### Navigation

- Minimal links (4-6 items)
- Semi-transparent background initially
- Solidifies on scroll
- Logo mark, not full logo

### Section Dividers

- Organic SVG shapes (waves, slopes, irregular edges)
- Mimic natural forms (water, mountains, horizons)
- Color transitions feel like landscape layers

---

## 10. Responsive Behavior

### Mobile Philosophy

**"Simplified but not diminished"**

### Mobile Adaptations

- Stack all layouts vertically
- Larger text for readability
- Full-width images for impact
- Simplified navigation (hamburger menu)
- Maintain visual hierarchy
- Generous touch targets (48px minimum)

### Tablet Behavior

- Two-column layouts where appropriate
- Maintain atmosphere and spacing
- Optimize image sizes for performance

### Desktop Enhancement

- Multi-column grids (3-4 columns)
- Hover states and subtle animations
- More sophisticated parallax effects
- Wider content measure (but still controlled)

---

## 11. Unique Distinguishing Elements

### Organic Transitions

The seamless flow between sections using natural shapes (not just straight lines) is **critical** to the wilderness feel. This should never feel like a standard business website.

### Map Integration

If location-based, integrate stylized maps that match the organic aesthetic (not standard Google Maps). Hand-drawn or illustrated style preferred.

### Image Galleries

Small clusters (2-4 images) that preview the experience, not overwhelming photo dumps. Images slightly overlap or have irregular arrangements.

### Texture & Depth

Subtle layering creates depth - overlapping elements, shadows, and transparency all work together.

## 12. Success Criteria

A successful implementation of this style should:

✓ **Make visitors want to book immediately** based on emotion, not logic  
✓ **Feel premium** without feeling exclusive or unwelcoming  
✓ **Load quickly** despite image-heavy design  
✓ **Work beautifully on mobile** where most browsing happens  
✓ **Tell a clear story** from top to bottom  
✓ **Maintain atmosphere** throughout the entire page  
✓ **Build trust** through professional execution  
✓ **Differentiate** from competitors through unique aesthetic

## Usage Notes

This guide is intentionally flexible - it captures the _spirit_ and _approach_ rather than exact specifications. When implementing:

- Adapt colors to match your specific brand while maintaining the mood
- Choose fonts that match the described personality
- Source or create imagery that fits the atmospheric guidelines
- Maintain the generous spacing and organic flow principles
- Keep the emotional journey at the center of design decisions

**Remember:** This isn't about copying a design, it's about capturing an **experience and feeling**. Every decision should ask: "Does this transport visitors into the natural environment we're selling?"

The current sections are:
(Inicio
La Empresa
Datos de Contacto
Programa de Integridad
Consultas
El Bosque
El Catamaran
Excursiones
Mapas
Galeria
Preguntas Frecuentes
Recomendaciones
Villa La Angostura
)

But those are too many for a navbar... we need to think a way of having submenus maybe. The important thing is too promote the "Bosque de Arrayanes" and the "Catamaran" and "Excursiones" which are the key services that bring in the money. We need a section for the "Tarifas"

And the LP must be in Spanish, English and Portuguese.

Somewhere in the LP we need to put this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BHDquvKIk
